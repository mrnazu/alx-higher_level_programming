# Second Trimester: Higher Level Programming Curriculum at ALX

Welcome to the Higher Level Programming curriculum at ALX! This curriculum covers a range of topics in computer science and software development, with a focus on Python programming and related technologies.

The curriculum is divided into several courses, each covering a different aspect of higher level programming. Here are the courses included in the curriculum:

## Python Basics

This course covers the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and modules. Students will also learn how to work with files, directories, and command line arguments.

## Object-Oriented Programming

This course covers the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how they apply to Python. Topics covered include classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## Interpreted Languages

This course introduces students to the concepts of interpreted languages, including dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and garbage collection. Students will also learn how to use Python as an interpreted language.

## Test Driven Development

This course covers the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD) and how to apply them in Python. Students will learn how to write tests, use test-driven development to design software, and use TDD to maintain and refactor existing code.

## Error Handling

This course covers how to handle errors and exceptions in Python. Topics covered include try/except blocks, raising exceptions, and handling errors in different contexts.

## I/O

This course covers input/output (I/O) operations in Python, including reading and writing files, working with standard input/output, and using serialization to save and load data.

## Web Scraping

This course covers how to scrape data from websites using Python. Topics covered include web requests, HTML parsing, and using libraries like BeautifulSoup.

## C

This course introduces students to the C programming language, including data structures, algorithms, and dynamic libraries.

## Data Structures

This section covers different data structures in C, including stacks/queues, doubly linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees.

## Algorithms

This section covers different algorithms in C, including sorting algorithms and Big O notation.

## Dynamic Libraries

This section covers how to use dynamic libraries in C, including how to create and use them.

## Linux

This course covers how to use Linux as a development environment, including processes and signals, scripting, and command line operations.

## Databases

This course covers how to work with databases in Python, including SQL and MySQL.

## Systems Engineering

This course covers the principles of systems engineering, including the Open Systems Interconnection Model and TCP/IP.

## Airbnb Project

This course is a capstone project that allows students to apply what they've learned in a real-world context. Students will work on a project that involves HTML, CSS, JSON, and unit testing.
